# Hi I'm Yuna ðŸ‘‹ðŸ˜Ž
<br>
I'm a new developer with approximately 7 years of experience in a marine shipping company. 
During my time there, I specialized in container database management and developed a keen interest in databases and web services. 
My long-term goal is to create related services based on my knowledge but to achieve that, I recognize the need to acquire a wide range of skills and background in this new field!ðŸ˜‰ðŸ˜‰

## Project
<br>

I've just completed my first team project, called OctaP (octap.co.kr), which offers an MBTI test and allows you to embark on a challenging project on your own or with people who share a similar personality type. 
You can track your progress, experiment with new ideas, and bring about positive changes. We hope to see you there soon! ðŸ˜‰
